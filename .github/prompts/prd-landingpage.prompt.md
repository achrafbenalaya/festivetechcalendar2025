description: 'Generate and enhance a Blazor WebAssembly landing page'
---

You are enhancing an existing Blazor WebAssembly landing page for a live demo.

### Design & UX
- Use a modern, premium design with gradient colors in dark yellow tones
- Apply elegant typography and consistent spacing
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively to bring the page to life ✨
- Add subtle hover effects and transitions (buttons, cards, navigation)
- Support both light and dark modes with a toggle
- Ensure the layout is fully responsive (desktop + mobile)

### Layout Requirements
- Header with:
  - Logo / app name
  - Navigation links (Features, Pricing, About, Contact)
  - Theme toggle
- Hero section:
  - Headline, short value proposition, call-to-action button
  - Use the image `festive.png`
- Features section:
  - Highlight key features using cards
- Footer:
  - Standard links
  - Copyright notice

### Technical Constraints (IMPORTANT)
- Use Blazor components (`.razor`)
- Do NOT use inline styles
- Put all styles in `app.css`
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Keep the implementation simple and readable

### Output Expectations
- Modify or create Blazor components as needed
- Update `app.css` for styling
- After generating code, explain:
  - Key design decisions
  - How dark mode works
  - Why this structure is suitable for Blazor WASM
